# High School Digital Solutions Portfolio

Welcome to my High School Digital Solutions Portfolio! This collection showcases a variety of projects and assignments completed during my high school years, spanning across four units. These projects represent my early forays into the world of digital solutions.

Please take these projects lightly, as they were my first introduction to many of these concepts, programming languages, and libraries. They represent the foundational steps of my learning journey in digital solutions. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed creating them!
